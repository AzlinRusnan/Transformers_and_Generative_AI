🤖 Understanding BERT and GPT in the Simplest Way
Both BERT and GPT are language models, which means they’re like smart brains trained to understand and work with human language.

## 🧠 BERT – Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
Think of BERT as a student who carefully reads a sentence from both directions – left to right AND right to left – to fully understand its meaning.

Example:

Sentence: "Ali ate rice at a delicious restaurant."

If you ask BERT: “What did Ali eat?”
BERT looks at the entire sentence, not just from the start. It understands context from both sides, so its answers are more accurate.

BERT is great for:

- Understanding sentence meaning

- Question answering

- Extracting key info from text

- Filling in missing words

🟢 BERT = Strong understanding (two-way thinking)

## 🧠 GPT – Generative Pre-trained Transformer
GPT is like a creative writer. It’s really good at continuing sentences, writing stories, or even drafting emails.

Example:

You write: "I love eating nasi lemak because..."

GPT will continue:

"...it tastes amazing and reminds me of family breakfasts."

GPT reads only from left to right, but it’s very good at predicting and generating natural-sounding text.

GPT is great for:

- Writing content

- Sentence completion

- Chatbots

- Translation

🟠 GPT = Great at writing and generating text (one-way thinking)

> | Analogy         | Focused reader              | Creative writer             |

### To summarise:

- BERT is like someone who reads carefully to understand.
- GPT is like someone who writes naturally to continue your thoughts.
